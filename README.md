## The Artefact 

The chosen artefact is a linocut poster by Semi Ruder from 1984, Netherlands. It was made during the time when the person identification number was about to be introduced as a centralized human accounting system, and wide protests spread across the country. The chosen poster is one of many opinions against this centralized data collection.

On the poster a woman is depicted, and all across the poster are written seemingly random numbers. They are also going over the women's portrait. All of this is printed in red-brown color. Then, the exact same composition is turned upside down and printed in black, on top of the first layer. |


## The Research

### Espionage

<img src="https://github.com/nekristiana/Transcoding/blob/master/images/espionage.jpg"/>

**Roles in Espionage**¹:
In most countries there are separate secret services in charge of espionage for national security. Such secret services can be subdivided into *security services, intelligence services, eavesdropping services and military intelligence services.* Employees who are employed by a secret service are called *intelligence officers.* Persons who possibly provide information for a financial fee but are not on the payroll are called *agents.*
In addition, there are *informers* who provide information to officers or agents without consideration and on their own initiative. Double spies are agents who provide intelligence officers on both sides with information, while a mole is an agent who deliberately infiltrates a hostile intelligence organization.

  How we can evade, protest, and sabotage today's pervasive digital surveillance by deploying more data, not less—and why we should.³ 

 > "They are calling us not to the barricades but to our computers, offering us ways to fight today's pervasive digital surveillance—the collection of our data by governments, corporations, advertisers, and hackers. To the toolkit of privacy protecting techniques and projects, they propose adding obfuscation: the deliberate use of ambiguous, confusing, or misleading information to interfere with surveillance and data collection projects. Brunton and Nissenbaum provide tools and a rationale for evasion, noncompliance, refusal, even sabotage—especially for average users, those of us not in a position to opt out or exert control over data about ourselves. Obfuscation will teach users to push back, software developers to keep their user data safe, and policy makers to gather data without misusing it."³
  
  **Brunton and Nissenbaum** present a guide to the forms and formats that **obfuscation** has taken and explain how to craft its implementation to suit the goal and the adversary. They describe a series of historical and contemporary examples, including **radar chaff deployed by World War II pilots, Twitter bots that hobbled the social media strategy of popular protest movements, and software that can camouflage users'** search queries and stymie online advertising. They go on to consider obfuscation in more general terms, discussing *why obfuscation is necessary, whether it is justified, how it works, and how it can be integrated with other privacy practices and technologies.*³

### Rudi Seidel

**Rudi Seidel** (born 1938) is without a doubt one of the most striking artists from Drenthe. As a painter, draftsman and graphic artist, he has always endeavored to convey a socially critical message with his work. For the most part autodidact, he developed an expressive figurative design with a very clear own face.

Artist Rudi Seidel makes **posters for anti-Nuclear movements, anti-racism, anti-militarism, social unrest, freedom of speech.** Other posters: https://search.iisg.amsterdam/Author/Home?author=Seidel%2C+Rudi%2C&type=Author&page=2

## History of Privacy in Netherlands

**Privacy emerged on the policy agenda in the late 1960s**. Privacy law and policy can be roughly divided into **two periods**: *two decades of creating general privacy frameworks in the Constitution and comprehensive data protection legislation, and two decades of updating these general frameworks in light of technological developments while also passing many privacy-diminishing laws to serve other policy goals.*

> The rise of the information society, the network society, and the risk society can explain a privacy policy change occurring somewhere during the 1980s. This change can be interpreted either as a shift from generally privacy-friendly policy to generally privacy-unfriendly policy, or as a shift in focus from general, privacy-centric framework regulation to specific, privacy-unrelated legislation targeted at other, higher-ranking policy goals, such as organized crime, immigration, and health and safety.⁴

**Dutch Data Protection Authority** (Dutch: *Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens*, AP) - independent administrative body that has been appointed by law as the supervisory authority for the processing of personal data.

**The Personal Data Protection Act** means that an organization may only process personal data that is demonstrably necessary for the organization and for which no explicit prohibition exists. Examples of this are medical, sexual, political data and data about membership of a trade union. For governments, the term 'demonstrably necessary' means that there must be a legal basis for the processing of data⁵

### Privacy nowadays in Netherlands

*Forensic investigations*
> “You are identifying and analyzing network threats and technical security risks. You therefore have a keen eye for the vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure, monitor these and act on incidents. You also coordinate - and advise on - vulnerability analyzes and penetration tests. And you also make your own analyzes. You are also a member of the cyber security incident response team. In your role you are constantly working on the mutual translation between tactical issues and implementation. In this way you contribute to the formulation of the information security policy and you work towards standards, supporting guidelines, procedures and baselines for information security.“⁷


**Privacy Laws**

> "The Dutch government conceded that due to the court’s decision providers would therefore not be required to store data for the purpose of investigations. Unsurprisingly, the Dutch authorities showed serious concern that the decision would seriously affect the ability of authorities to “fight crime”. The ministry is seriously concerned about the effect this will have on fighting crime.” ⁸ ⁹

<details><summary>Color</summary><br>
Layer 1 – matt color (reddish, dark brown). Texture is more grainier than layer 2.<br>
  Layer 2 – matt color, with a bit of a gloss. (black). Applied on top of the layer 1 color. <br><br> The layer 1 is visible through layer 2 as a texture and also the layer 1 see-through the layer 2 is a bit shinier that the layer 2.<br> </details>

<details><summary>Texts on the poster</summary><br>
All across the poster are numbers randomly placed.
On the bottom horizontal, below the actual graphic are several texts:
“Zonder nummer bestaatmen niet?” (title), written with a graphite pencil, 3B or 2B softness unsharpened.<br><br>
1. “Rudi Seidel” (signature), written with a sharpened pencil, B softness, but the line is much thinner, therefore I suggest it i sharpened.<br><br>
2. “ ‘84 ” (year), written with a harder pencil, could be H hardness, sharpened, almost the lightest/thinnest line of all.<br><br>
3. “Tweesporesnveg I, 9403 EM Assen, tel. 0592017080” (contact information), written with the same pencil as the signature.<br><br>
  4. “N.a.v. persoonsregistratie” (comment), written the most lighter of all, but not sure if added by the artist or archivers.<br><br> </details>

<details><summary>Paper</summary><br>
Paper is similar to Romandruk we have in school – yellowish, with a rougher texture than usual papers, with a lot more air in it (so appears thicker that the actual grammage). The weight of the paper could be around 120-140m3g, thinner than the usual poster papers.</details>
<details><summary>Damages</summary><br>
  The poster has small pin-like holes in the corners of the poster. 1 in each upper corner and 2 irregular in each bottom ones. It gives a suggestion it has been pinned to a surface before.</details>

<details><summary>Smell</summary>
Like an old book in a library.
</details>

<details><summary>Technique</summary>
Looks like linocut. Other posters are engraved in wood as well.

</details>
<details><summary>How to describe/translate this work (in words, numbers or any other technique)</summary><br><br>
WHY?<br>
A person would do this to make the work long-lasting and accessible to people that in the future migHt not access the work (either because the work is gone or the person is disabled in some way or the machine would need to reproduce it)<br><br>
HOW?<br>
Dragging the mouse along the illustration lines (involves an interpretation of the work by the person who does that). The line is noted as:<br><br>
1. a visual line<br><br>
2. coordinates in form of numbers (in this case the reproducible material is always placed on a before-made grid, so the base and coordinate system reference is always the same and multiple artworks are easily re-translatable back from the  “numbers” to possible original appearance<br><br>
3. placing dots on the edges of any  illustration/visual information. The more dots the more precise.<br><br>
4. Describing it with words (audial / written)<br><br>
5. Playing it with sounds / notes. (coordinate grid again should be the same, so that all the artworks can be translated via the same system)<br><br>
6. Throwing 1000 similar images from a google image database, that all togehter might reseble the original artwork<br><br>
7. many separate images given and the original is fantasized by the person via associations/styles/themes of given images<br><br>
8. combining/morphing/collaging 1000 images in one to recreate the original<br>
9. the poster is somehow re-printed in texture and the viewer can touch it and feel what is on it and where everything is placed<br><br>
10. The artwork is read in separate categories: <br><br>
		a. style of the work (handmade, illustrative, typographic poster, <br>
		b. abstract painting, <br>
		c. colors used,<br>
		d. texts on the poster indicated, <br>
  e. composition<br> </details>


## Potential Startingpoints

### Sketch No 1 
**Location translation**
The poster could be placed on underlying grid with coordinates on the crossroads of the grid lines. Therefore these indication points could be used to transcode the poster in many different ways or just make a vectorized clone of it, away from digital .jpg image.

<img src="https://github.com/nekristiana/Transcoding/blob/master/images/sketch1.jpg" width="70%">

### Sketch No 2 
**Written or spoken word**
The poster could be translated by someone writing or describing verbaly the artwork. This transcoding would be interesting in a sense that it is very open to interpretation - both how the talker describes it and how the receiver imagines it.

<img src="https://github.com/nekristiana/Transcoding/blob/master/images/sketch2.jpg" width="70%">

### Sketch No 3
**Audio**
Similar as in Sketch No.1, there is an underlying grid and each point has its own sound from lowest to highest octave. Knowing the logic of the sound distribution on the grid, onecould recreate the poster by hearing the computer "playing" the coordinate dots. 
<img src="https://github.com/nekristiana/Transcoding/blob/master/images/sketch3.jpg" width="70%">

### Sketch No 4a 
**Found pictures thrown together to form associative original**

<img src="https://github.com/nekristiana/Transcoding/blob/master/images/sketch4_1.jpg" width="70%">

### Sketch No 4b 
**Morphed found pictures together to create a morph image close to original**  

<img src="https://github.com/nekristiana/Transcoding/blob/master/images/sketch4.jpg" width="70%">

### Sketch No 5 
**Tangible translation**
3D scanned or digitally sculpted surface then printed out on 3D printer or made with CNC.

**Quesion 1** – *How to preserve and present the vibe / mood of the work?*
Method Nr.4 (a+b) – using the human ability to “connect dots” in associations – associative picture package

**Quesion 2** – *How the way of transcoding refers to the the topic “Privacy”?*

1. Traanscding could be visualised with numbers? other symbols? 
2. the privacy shows in the technique of transcoding –  in the sense that the work is never transcoded perfectly – it is always shown through a mediator that stands in between the original object and the person who wants to view it. The mediator being the visualisation the transcoding uses – and alternative to the original image, that tries to show the original image.

**Quesion 3** – *What is the urgency of preserving this object?*
There is no other concrete urgency than the topic itself. It is a symbolic artefact from the past that represents and talks about the issues of the present and the concerns of the future, communicated to the future.

**Quesion 4** – *What does it mean to transcode “precisely”?*
To bring across the visual, theme, the vibe of the work and the composition.

## Transcoding 1

<details><summary>The written description of the work</summary><br>
The poster smells like an old book in a library. Technique looks like a linocut, but other posters of the artist in the same folders are engraved in wood as well.<br><br>
The artwork is printed in two colors – black and red-brown(-ish). Layer 1 brown is a matt color (reddish, dark brown). Texture is more grainier than layer 2 black one.
Layer 2 is a black matt color, with a bit of a gloss. Applied on top of the layer 1. The layer 1 is visible through layer 2 as a texture and also the layer 1 is see-through the layer 2 is a bit shinier that the layer 2.<br><br>
All across the poster are numbers randomly placed. On the bottom horizontal, below the actual graphic are several texts: “*Zonder nummer bestaatmen niet?*” (title), written with a graphite pencil, 3B or 2B softness unsharpened. “*Rudi Seidel*” (signature), written with a sharpened pencil, B softness, but the line is much thinner, therefore I suggest it i sharpened. “*'84* ” (year), written with a harder pencil, could be H hardness, sharpened, almost the lightest/thinnest line of all. “*Tweesporesnveg I, 9403 EM Assen, tel. 0592017080*” (contact information), written with the same pencil as the signature. “*N.a.v. persoonsregistratie*” (comment), written the most lighter of all, but not sure if added by the artist or archivers.<br><br>
The paper is similar to *Romandruk* we have in school – yellowish, with a rougher texture than usual papers, with a lot more air in it (so appears thicker that the actual grammage). The weight of the paper could be around 120-140m3g, thinner than the usual poster papers.<br><br>
The poster has small pin-like holes in the corners of the poster. One in each upper corner and two irregular in each bottom ones. It gives a suggestion it has been pinned to a surface before.

## Transcoding 2

**Handdrawn poster theme in 3D environment. The aim of this approach is to see how untrained hand interprets the appearance and 3D environment helps to see the layers of the actual work - colorwise and compositionwise.**

<details><summary>Steps of transcoding taken during the Transcoding Nr.2</summary><br><br>
This transcoding included such transcoding steps: <br><br>
1.IISG scans the original poster and saves it as a .jfif picture; 
2.I save it in my computer and change it to .jpeg format; 3. I put it in Windows Paint 3D and try to redraw the original by looking at it and drawing with my hand on a computer. 4.The touchpad of the computer interprets my hand movements as strokes in the drawing program and visualizes them on the screen.<br>

**Digital line drawing (2D).** In this transcoding the colors or materiality are not important. The most important part is as clear and as simple as possible translate and copy the posters composition.

## Transcoding 4

**Digital line drawing including a hint of color.** This specific tryout is just a sketch made with filter to see if it would be worth trying. I decided not to continue with this method.

## Transcoding 5

**Transcoding through colors**.

*Starting from this transcoding, I am trying to include a hint of the topic of hiding ones privacy and the context of the poster.*

1. First tryout was converting the original poster into fragmented color mosaic. 

2. Second tryout is handpicked colors from different hues of two colors used in the poster - brownish-red and black.

   ***This method I see as a potential to create a camouflage to the poster, starting to talk about the context of the poster - people not wanting to be governmentally visible.* An interesting aspect is also the fact that even though the posters seem to contain only two coors - brown and black - it actually shows that it has much more hues. I see it as a symbol to the governments urge to assign numbers to people - *one can do it and make the person a dry, one-sided number, but it will never contain all of the persons "hues" or personality and values, for example.***

## Transcoding 6

**Binary code**

A tryout. Dutch people at the time (1970's and 1980's) were against assigning centralized numbers to people in the Netherlands. Here I am trying out a possible direction to "hide" the poster behind numbers, in a way how the artist already does it in the poster in analogue way. Using the transcoding itself as a camouflage, to represent the topic of the poster and the vibe in the country at the time. This transcoding does not really work as it seems only illustrative, but the thought of the camoflague I am taking with me.

## Transcoding 7

**Connecting numbers**

Here I am in a *process of thinking* how to transcode the poster through coding. Overall I am thinking of creating a camouflage through transcoding. It would serve in two ways:

1. provide very clear and precise translation of the poster that is easy to read as data 
2. at the same time visually it would mask the original poster, serve as a camouflage.

These two side-by-side existing ways of transcoding would create interesting **contradiction**: **using the most precise particle (number) which is meant to reveal the material at the utmost precision to actually hide the material.** It would serve as a nowadays version of the poster, as the artist has already, in my opinion, using the so feared numbers in the poster, to actually hide behind them

However, in this transcodin **I am trying out the thought of number drawing, where you connect the numbers to get an image.** In this case I am just connecting the same numbers with themseves (all Nr.1, all Nr.2's and so on), to see if it would be possible to place the numbers on a page if original poster wouldn't be visible, just using the lines as a guide.

## Transcoding 8
As a takeway technique I am choosing the Transocing 5 - color scheme of an image or using coding to generate the color scheme overlay of the poster. The process starts with an learning example in pointilism, example by Dan Shiffman (like in the image below). The aim is to create shapes colored according to pixels in an image (in my case: original poster, and if that is successful - any uploaded image). This part is ongoing and therefore not documented yet.

Below is the first tryout of applying and customizing pointilism js5 code to an image of my choice, in this case - Semi Ruder poster.

Finalized transcoding using js5 pointillism, changing the pixel size to 5 points to achieve the translation to a close-to-original image

# Reflections

This assignment interested me mostly through the means of transcoding a physical object into something not tangible, into a structure or an invention of a method to recreate the object in a non-material way. I saw it as a brain exercise to try to figure out a way how to arrive at the final destination (the original poster) each time walking a different path. The challenge of disassembling a known object to pieces and reconstructing it with a completely different "genetic code" is the part that excited me the most in this project. Also the fact that the transcoding can happen in the most simplest of ways by, for example, describing a work or re-drawing it with a human hand, then scanning it, and making a hand-drawn image into a digital .jpg file - a mind-bending excerise to try actually seeing how transcoding actually looks like and how present it actually is in our lives.

Hardest part for me has been translating the *meaning and context* of the poster, but I did come to a conclusion to use the same technique Semi Ruder has used in his poster: not wanting to be part of the system of numbers, *he uses the numbers to hide the person behind them*. When I noticed that in the poster I realized it is a logical step to use such camoflague also in nowadays context, therefore I ended up using the idea of color scheme from transcoding 5. The average color scheme of the uploaded image would act as a filter and go on top of the image, *leaving the image abstract and camouflaged with its own information.*


# Outcomes

https://nekristiana.github.io/TranscodingWebsite/

The outcomes of the assignment so far are 7 physical transcodings and 6 coding-related ideas of transcoding. Four of the transcoding tryouts only deal with the physical appearance and composition of the poster, and three of them connects the visual aspects of the poster as well as the context and theme of it. So far I value most the Transcoding 5  which made me arrive to the coding transcoding part of creating a tool that pixelizes the original image with its own color pixels creating a camoflague on top, abstracting the image from recognition with its own information. The latest outcome is a video which demonstrates the pixelation of two juxtaposed images - Seidi Ruder poster and my own selfportrait recognized by face-recognition software on Iphone - placed in a website.
